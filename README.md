# Machine-Learning-Lab
This course involves experiments on Machine Learning techniques, including data preprocessing, classifiers (Bayesian, Decision Trees, SVM, k-NN), regression models, and dataset handling. It also covers evaluation metrics (precision, accuracy) and efficiency enhancement methods such as ensemble learning and boosting.
