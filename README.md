# Machine-Learning-Lab
# Machine Learning Laboratory

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This course provides hands-on experience with key Machine Learning techniques.  
Students will perform experiments on data preprocessing, classification, regression, and model evaluation using real-world datasets.  

## ðŸ”¬ Experiments
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, handling missing values  
- **Classifiers**:  
  - Bayesian Classifiers  
  - Decision Trees  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN)  
- **Regression Models**: Linear & Non-linear regression  
- **Model Evaluation**: Precision, accuracy, and other performance metrics  
- **Advanced Techniques**: Ensemble methods, Boosting for classifier efficiency
